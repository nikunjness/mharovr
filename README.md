A project for Rajasthan Government Hackathon 

Every year thousands of international tourists visit Rajasthan. A large number of these tourists are backpackers who have limited budget and time to spend here. 
Most of the times they struggle to decide which places to visit and which places to skip. They are restricted to make their choices based on people's opinion in public forums. This is not an ideal solution and leaves tourist with bad experience.

We, team MharoVR took this as our problem statement and wanted to help these tourist make better decision. 

So, How do we do it? 

How about giving them a real experice of visitng particular place using VR technology? We did exactly the same. We created a mobile app and web portal which lists all tourist places across cities. 
Tourist can explore tourist places in city they are in and can take a VR tour using a VR headset. Those who don't have a VR headset ready can take 360 degree tour using their laptops/PCs.
